## Overview
Google Play Books is an e-book reader with a feature that I enjoy: for each book in your library, it generates a Google doc which contains all of the highlights and notes you made in that particular book. I have always been a heavy e-book highlighter - whenever I read a line that catches my interest, sounds like good life advice to remember, or is something that aligns with my sense of humour, I highlight it and maybe even write a short note. 

Normally, once I finish a book, I would have no particular reason to look back at the highlights and notes that I took. But this is sad, since what's the point of highlighting in the first place if I never look back at it? **This project is a way to encourage a sentimental book reader to look back at their highlights and notes, in the format of a quiz** -- presented with a quote you highlighted, can you correctly select which book in your library it came from? The goal is to refresh your mind with your past highlights while engaging in a bit of a challenge. Even just during my time developing this, I've gained immense pleasure looking back at the lines I've highlighted (and the occasional corresponding notes!).

Coming feature: the ability to "star" a quote so that you can store and look at a list of memorable quotes that you want to save all in one place.


Demo / screenshots coming soon.
